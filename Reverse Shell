As you'll notice, in Kali Linux, you can employ the "reverse_tcp" exploit to establish a connection with the target by employing a simple curl command in the terminal.

We employ the payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp, a type of payload within the Metasploit Framework, to establish a Meterpreter connection to a remote machine through a reverse PHP shell.
This payload proves particularly valuable in scenarios where the target machine hosts a web server running PHP and lacks alternative access avenues through vulnerabilities or valid credentials.
