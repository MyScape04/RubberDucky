# RubberDucky
Building a Custom Rubber Ducky with Raspberry Pi Pico for Cybersecurity Tasks.

Introduction:
Welcome to the repository for the "Making a Custom Rubber Ducky with Raspberry Pi Pico for Cybersecurity Tasks" project. In this project, we're going to combine the Raspberry Pi Pico with a Rubber Ducky. The Rubber Ducky is a tool that can do more than just automate tasks – it's also used in cybersecurity and hacking.

One of its main jobs is to help us check how secure computer systems are and find vulnerabilities. This way, we can fix issues before they're taken advantage of.

We'll use the Raspberry Pi Pico and also other tools like GitHub, Metasploit, and Netcat. To control everything, we'll be using Python. By the end of the project, we'll have our very own customized Rubber Ducky ready to go.

By the end of the project, you'll find here our custom-made Rubber Ducky scripts, the exploits, and the code used – everything you need to delve into the world of cybersecurity exploration and experimentation.
